ptouch-driver (1.3-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * debian/postinst: Added automatic update of PPD files of already existing
    print queues when the package is updated.
  * debian/rules: Removed the Foomatic printer XML files, they are already
    contained in foomatic-db.
  * debian/rules: Suppress running dh_auto_test, it runs often before the
    Makefile is created (dh bug?).
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Added support for patches.
  * debian/control: Set section to "text".
  * debian/local/apport-hook.py, debian/rules: Added Apport hook.
  * debian/patches/foomatic-data-fixes.patch: Moved the Foomatic data fixes
    into a proper patch.
